Currently, I'm immersed in a 9-month Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp, which will conclude at the end of February 
2024 üí™üèª. Consequently, the most recent projects you'll find on my GitHub are those developed throughout this Bootcamp. 
Most of these projects have been team collaborations, as there's a significant emphasis on collaborative work and 
applying the Scrum methodology to address real-world challenges.

Regarding methodologies, we also employ one called "Active Pedagogy." This method involves receiving a project briefing 
where recommended technologies are indicated (though not limiting), and within a maximum of two to three weeks, 
presenting the results to stakeholders.

Active Pedagogy means that, on our own, we must research the proposed technologies, even if we have no prior knowledge. 
By the end of the project, we've gained significant knowledge about topics we initially knew nothing about. Learning in 
this way is rewarding.

Therefore, several of the badges you see here represent the technologies I've learned throughout various projects in 
the Bootcamp. It's important to mention that I don't consider myself an "expert" in any of them yet, but I'm working 
diligently to become one! üòâ

Thanks to the Bootcamp, I'm leaning towards the field of Data Engineering, but I'm also really into Deep Learning, 
particularly Computer Vision.
